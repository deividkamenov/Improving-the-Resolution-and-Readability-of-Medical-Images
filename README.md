# Improving-the-Resolution-and-Readability-of-Medical-Images
Digital image processing is a modern, extremely active and applicable scientific field
that combines research techniques from both mathematics and informatics. Its
applications are countless and can be useful in every aspect of human life related to
digital images. 

The project “Improving the Resolution and Readability of Two Dimensional Medical
Images through Mathematical transformations” is focused mainly in the field of
bioinformatics and image processing. It aims to improve the resolution and readability
of images with medical purpose. Despite this, it is multipurpose and can be
applicable in many other areas like non-medical images. The main idea is devoted to
the important and still unsolved issue in the medical X-ray and CT imaging how to
improve the image resolution and get better image readability without exposing the
patient to higher radiation because the standard approach of solving this problem is
to use higher dose of radiation for improvement of these characteristics.
The purpose is to lower the chance of doctor error caused by not having enough information for an adequate diagnose
and to increase the chances of successful disease treatment as well as 
applying as little radiation as possible while still getting the best image possible. 
The main goal is to automatize the process, and apply it to large datasets of images
without the need of a programmer, doctor or a person to the whole. The improved
data can be used for further analysis from specialists, educating inexperienced
students or even improving a machine learning algorithm process or dataset.
